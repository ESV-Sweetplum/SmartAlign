# SmartAlign

Fixes timing line and object misalignment by changing the precision of timing lines to be that of objects. Now works with signature changes and is generally more consistent with floating-point BPMs!

The original plugin was made by [Kusa](https://github.com/Illuminati-CRAZ), and it can be found [here](https://github.com/Illuminati-CRAZ/Align).
